# 2wd-robot
Autonomous 2wd robot using ROS on RPi 4 B

## ROS Installation

The robot setup is supposed to run on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic. [ROS Melodic]() is intended to run with this Ubuntu version.

Use `catkin build` instead of `catkin_make`.

From the [catkin tutorial](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials) here are the commands used to create the workspace:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/ros/src
$ cd ~/ros/
$ catkin build
```
